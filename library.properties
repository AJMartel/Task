sentence=A library that makes creating complex mulitple task projects easy.
paragraph=This implements a Nonpreemptive multitasking library which is effecient in speed and memory, which is good for small Arduino hardware.  While multitasking is an advanced topic, our friends at AdaFruit have a great article on it here (https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-1?view=all),  Samples include blinking an LED without using delay(), monitoring and reacting to a button press, and cross task messaging. Tested on esp8266.
